Classification with Logistic Regression

 Objective
To build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression on a real-world dataset (Breast Cancer Wisconsin) and evaluate it using standard metrics.

Dataset
- *Name:* Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset  
- *Source:* sklearn.datasets  
- *Classes:* Benign (0) vs Malignant (1)

Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

 Steps Performed

1. Loaded the Breast Cancer dataset
2. Split the data into training and test sets
3. Standardized the features using StandardScaler
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model using sklearn
5. Predicted class labels and probabilities
6. Evaluated the model using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score
   - ROC-AUC Curve
7. Plotted the sigmoid function
8. Tuned the classification threshold

 Evaluation Results

- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall
- ROC-AUC Score
- Classification Report

 Plots Included

- Confusion Matrix (heatmap)
- ROC Curve
- Sigmoid Function Curve

Threshold Tuning

Adjusted the classification threshold (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.6) to see the impact on precision and recall.
